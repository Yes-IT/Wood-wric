  Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 9 ( IANS) Dissident Independent MLA P.V. Anvar, who
  has been ousted from the Left Democratic Front, on Wednesday attended the
  ongoing Assembly session, and claimed the Chief Minister was flying to the US
  to settle some issues, the details of which he (Anvar) will reveal soon.


  On Tuesday Anvar did not attend the session as the Speaker allocated him a seat amongst the opposition.


  Just before reaching the Assembly, he claimed that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his family were leaving for the US very soon.


  “The trip is to settle some issues and if need be I will come out with the reason for his visit,” said Anvar.


  CM Vijayan did not attend the Assembly session as he was indisposed and down with a fever and was resting at his official residence.


  For the past month, Anvar has been going hammer and tongs against CM Vijayan in particular and the CPI(M) in general levelling allegations against ADGP M.R. Ajith Kumar and the P.Sasi, the CM’s political secretary, for aiding the gold smugglers.
