## Letâ€™s Build Something Together

The Wood Industry Resource Collaborative (WIRC) is made up of amazing
associations that support skilled trade education. Our purpose is to provide a
collection of tools and solutions for the wood industry to attract and retain
employees, while improving the overall perception of the industry.

Our mission is to ensure that the wood industry continues to thrive and evolve
as a vital sector of the global economy, and that the workforce of the future
is equipped with everything needed to help us get there.
